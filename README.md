# BattleBots_Java
#### A fun, turn-based battle bots game, in Java!
#### Here, you can find both the old Python version of the game, and the new version, in Java!
## How to run this game:
### Java Version (much faster):
- Download the files in `/Main_Game` in **one directory**, then open that directory in the terminal.

- Once you are in the directory of the game, execute these in the terminal:
```zsh
javac *.java
java Game
```
####If you're running this game online:
- Download all the files, then run Game.java (or compile Game.java then run the compiled file)
### Python Version (original, might be easier to understand):
 - Download the files in `/old_python_verson` in **one directory**.
 - Run Bots `Maybe Main.py`
## A little about the history of this game:
AFAIK, this game was originally created during Summer 2022 or before for an iDTech summer camp.
The basis of this game is that you code your own robot, giving it stats and an AI that tells it what to do.
